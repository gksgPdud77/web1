<h2>WEB</h2>
<p>The World Wide Web (WWW, W3) refers to a global information space where people can share information through computers connected to the Internet. Often referred to simply as the Web. The term is often used synonymously with the Internet, but strictly speaking, they are different concepts. The Web is just a service that operates on the Internet, like e-mail. However, since 1993, the Web has taken an absolute position in the structure of the Internet.

It is also referred to as a transmission method in which pictures and text are exchanged using HTTP protocol, hypertext, HTML format, etc. on the Internet.
